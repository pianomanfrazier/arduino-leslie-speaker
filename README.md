# Arduino Leslie Speaker

## TODO

Acceleration and deceleration curves are very slow at the slow end and fast at the fast end. The curves should be more linear.

Add more documentation.

## TASKS

- read pots for acc/dec times
- read pots for fast/slow speeds

## Documentation

- add schema diagrams
    - foot switch schema
    - controller schema
