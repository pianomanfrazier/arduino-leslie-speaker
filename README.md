# Arduino Leslie Speaker

## TODO

Acceleration and deceleration curves are very slow at the slow end and fast at the fast end. The curves should be more linear.

Add more documentation.

## TASKS

- reduce PWM noise from the power supply
- design PCBs for the circuit
- make a list of supplies to DIY this project
- connect amp & speaker to power supply
    - see if we need to increase the power supply for amp
    - TDA2050 Mono Audio see specs below
